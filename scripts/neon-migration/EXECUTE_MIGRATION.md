# Execute Neon Migration - Step by Step Guide

I've created a comprehensive migration plan with automated scripts. However, since this requires authentication with Neon and Vercel accounts, and involves production data migration, I'll guide you through the manual execution process for safety.

## Current Status ‚úÖ

**Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Full migration plan created (`NEON_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`)
2. ‚úÖ Complete opportunities analysis (`NEON_VERCEL_OPPORTUNITIES.md`)
3. ‚úÖ All 6 migration scripts created and ready
4. ‚úÖ Neon CLI installed (`neonctl` v2.15.1)

**What You Have:**
- Current Neon Database Details (from `Dev Drop/Vercel NEON API etc.txt`)
- Stack Auth credentials
- Vercel project linked
- All migration scripts in `scripts/neon-migration/`

## üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended Approach)

Since this is a production migration with sensitive data, I recommend a **manual execution with automated helpers** approach:

### Option 1: Use Neon Console (Safest)

1. **Create New Project via Neon Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.neon.tech
   - Click "New Project"
   - Name: `better-being-production`
   - Region: `eu-central-1` (same as current)
   - Compute: Start with 0.25 CU, autoscale to 4 CU
   - Click "Create Project"

2. **Get New Connection Strings:**
   ```
   Main (Pooled): postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]-pooler.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb
   Main (Direct): postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host].eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb
   ```

3. **Create Development Branch:**
   - In project ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí "Create Branch"
   - Name: `development`
   - Parent: `main`
   - This will be your shadow DB

4. **Update Environment Variables:**
   Create `.env.neon.new` file:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="[New pooled connection string]"
   DATABASE_URL_DIRECT="[New direct connection string]"
   SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="[Development branch connection string]"
   NEON_PROJECT_ID="[Your new project ID]"
   ```

### Option 2: Use Automated CLI Script

I can create a Windows-compatible PowerShell script that will execute the migration automatically. Would you like me to:

1. **Create a PowerShell automation script?**
2. **Proceed with manual step-by-step execution?**
3. **Set up API-based automation using the Neon REST API?**

## üìã What Needs to Be Done

Here's what the migration will do:

### Phase 1: Database Setup (30 min)
- Create new Neon project with optimal settings
- Set up branching strategy
- Configure autoscaling
- Export connection strings

### Phase 2: Schema Migration (15 min)
- Generate Drizzle migrations
- Apply schema to new database
- Create performance indexes
- Verify schema integrity

### Phase 3: Data Migration (30-60 min)
- Export all data from current DB
- Import to new DB
- Verify data integrity
- Update sequences

### Phase 4: Vercel Integration (20 min)
- Configure Neon Vercel integration
- Set up environment variables
- Configure preview branches
- Test deployment

### Phase 5: Optimization (15 min)
- Apply performance optimizations
- Set up monitoring
- Configure caching
- Create materialized views

### Phase 6: Production Deployment (30 min)
- Run final tests
- Deploy to production
- Verify functionality
- Set up monitoring

**Total Time:** 2.5-3.5 hours

## üîê Required Information

Before proceeding, I need:

1. **Neon API Key** (for automation)
   - Get from: https://console.neon.tech/app/account/api-keys
   - Create new API key named "Better Being Migration"

2. **Vercel Token** (already have: `edfzz8I5KjxJpODnIplQUvS9`)
   - Already provided in your details file ‚úÖ

3. **Confirmation of maintenance window**
   - When can we run this? (Recommend: weekend, low traffic)
   - Duration: 3-4 hours with a buffer

---

## ‚ö° Automated Execution (If You Want Full Automation)

I can create a single PowerShell script that will:

1. Authenticate with Neon API
2. Create new project
3. Run all migration steps
4. Configure Vercel
5. Deploy to production

**To proceed with automation, provide:**
- Neon API Key
- Confirmation that you want automated execution
- Preferred maintenance window

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Measures

Regardless of approach chosen:

- ‚úÖ Current database will NOT be touched until final cutover
- ‚úÖ Complete backup created before any changes
- ‚úÖ Rollback plan in place
- ‚úÖ Testing on preview environment first
- ‚úÖ Gradual cutover with monitoring

---

## üìû Next Steps

**Choose your path:**

**Path A: Manual Guided Execution** (Safest, Recommended)
- I'll guide you through each step
- You execute commands manually
- Full control at every stage
- Takes 3-4 hours with breaks

**Path B: Semi-Automated** (Balanced)
- I create Windows batch/PowerShell scripts
- You run each script after reviewing
- Automated validation checks
- Takes 2-3 hours

**Path C: Fully Automated** (Fastest, requires Neon API key)
- Single script execution
- I handle everything
- You monitor progress
- Takes 1-2 hours

**Which path would you like to take?**

## üîß Immediate Action Items

While you decide, you can prepare:

1. **Create backup directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p backup/data
   mkdir -p backup/schema
   ```

2. **Test current database connection:**
   ```bash
   psql "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_QPxIhJc62CBt@ep-sweet-rain-agsv46iq-pooler.c-2.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb" -c "\dt"
   ```

3. **Review migration plan:**
   - Read: `NEON_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
   - Read: `NEON_VERCEL_OPPORTUNITIES.md`

4. **Schedule maintenance window:**
   - Pick a time window (3-4 hours)
   - Notify team/users
   - Prepare rollback plan

## ‚ùì Questions to Answer

Before we proceed, please confirm:

1. ‚úÖ Do you have access to Neon Console (https://console.neon.tech)?
2. ‚úÖ Do you have access to Vercel Dashboard?
3. ‚ùì Do you want to proceed with migration now, or schedule it?
4. ‚ùì Which execution path do you prefer (A, B, or C)?
5. ‚ùì Can you provide a Neon API key for automation?

**Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll guide you through the chosen path!**
